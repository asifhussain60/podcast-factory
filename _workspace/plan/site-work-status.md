# Current work - status

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29 1:14 PM EDT (translation-edition PDF render fixes)

**Current branch merged into develop:** Islamic/al-anwaar-al-lateefah.

**What changed:** The book PDF renderer now wraps inline Arabic runs in isolated
RTL spans before Playwright PDF rendering, with print CSS for `.ar-inline`. The
title-page/first-chapter pagination rule no longer emits a blank spacer page, and
`validate_book_ready.py` now blocks rendered PDFs with blank text pages. These
fixes do not rerun ingest, compose, illustration, or slide authoring.

**Current translation-edition state:** `mukhtasar-ul-asar-2` has a rerendered
titled PDF in `content/Islamic/mukhtasar-ul-asar-2/book/` and the Google Drive
Podcast Library copy was refreshed by `build_book_pdf.py`.

**Site verification:** `node --check plan-dashboard/scripts/render-book-pdf.mjs`,
`npm run lint:views`, `validate_book_ready.py mukhtasar-ul-asar-2`, Poppler
page-by-page blank audit, and focused podcast regression tests all pass.

**Current Al Anwaar state:** vol-01 has a 27-entry glossary and Arabic script in
all 11 chapters. Ship validation passes all 14 gates, including G13
`arabic-script-in-chapters`.

**Prior Studio status carried from develop:** Session 32 reworked the Studio Arabic
review/editor shell, unified action panel, Noise tool, raw Arabic styling, reading
width, and left-gutter mark icons. Deferred design decisions remain: NarrativeScroll
theme exception/retheme, REQ-010 typography sweep, section ids/number markers,
figure wrappers, print/smooth-scroll/metadata polish, system-map density split, and
SpendChart dead-code removal.
