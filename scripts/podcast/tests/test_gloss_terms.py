"""Glossed-term harvesting, and the terms that reach the page with no script.

Every case is drawn from what the five live editions actually printed on
2026-08-03, when Asif read `al-anwaar-al-lateefah` and asked why the page said
`marifah` instead of Arabic. The harvester had found ONE candidate in a book that
italicises 261 distinct terms, because it only ever looked inside parentheses —
and the articulation pass writes the other shape.
